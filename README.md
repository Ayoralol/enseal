# EnSeal

Handmade encoder and decoder!

## Encoding

Import a .txt file with the message you want to encode and get the encoded .txt file back along with a second .txt file containing your EnSeal Key.
Optionally you can also provide an EnSeal key that has already been generated for you!

##### Warning

The import file for encoding a message must only contain characters present on an ANSI QWERTY Keyboard.

## Decoding

Provide the EnSeal key and import your already encoded .txt file to get the original message back! (to be made)
